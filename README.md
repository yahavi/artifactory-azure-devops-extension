# Overview
JFrog Artifactory provides tight integration with VSTS and TFS through the **JFrog Artifactory VSTS Extension**.
Beyond managing efficient deployment of your artifacts to Artifactory, the extension lets you capture information about artifacts deployed, dependencies resolved, environment data associated with the build runs and more, 
that effectively facilitates fully traceable builds.
See the full extension documentation at the [VSTS and TFS Artifactory Extension User Guide](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/VSTS+and+TFS+Artifactory+Extension).

# Download and Installation
The extension is available for installation on your VSTS organization in the [VSTS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JFrog.jfrog-artifactory-vsts-extension).
To install the extension on TFS, see the [install extensions for Team Foundation Server (TFS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts/marketplace/get-tfs-extensions?view=tfs-2018#install-extensions-while-connected-to-tfs) documentation page.

# Building and Testing the Sources
## Building

1. Clone the code from git.
2. To Build and create the JFrog Artifactory VSTS extension vsix file, run the following command.
    ```
    npm run create
    ```
After the build process is completed, you'll find the vsix file in the project directory.
The vsix file can be loaded into VSTS and TFS.

## Testing
To run the tests, use the following commands:
1. Set the VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_URL, VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME and VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD environment variables with your Artifactory URL, username and password:

    export VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME=admin
    export VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD=password
    ```
    
2. Set the VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_DOCKER_REGISTRY and VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_DOCKER_REPO environment variables with your Artifactory Docker registry domain and Artifactory Docker repository name:
    ```
    export VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_DOCKER_REGISTRY='localhost:8081/docker-local'
    export VSTS_ARTIFACTORY_DOCKER_REPO=docker-local
    ```
    
3. Run the following commands:
    ```
    npm i -g jfrog-cli-go
    npm t
    ```
